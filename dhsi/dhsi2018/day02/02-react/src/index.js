import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './containers/App'; //. identifies this as a local file instead of a package file

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')); //<App /> is an example of JSX and requires you to import React into the file wherever you write JSX
